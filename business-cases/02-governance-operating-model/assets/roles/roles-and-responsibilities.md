# Governance Roles & Responsibilities

This document details the roles supporting the Governance Operating Model.
Roles are structured according to the established ownership layers:
Governance, Control and Execution.

The objective is to clarify accountability, decision rights and execution
responsibilities across the data lifecycle.

### Governance Layer – Strategic Accountability

Defines enterprise-level direction, standards and accountability for
data governance, ensuring alignment with business strategy and regulatory
expectations.

### Control Layer – Domain Ownership & Prioritization

Owns data domains and data quality outcomes within a business context,
translating governance direction into domain-level decisions and priorities.

### Execution Layer – Operational Delivery

Executes data quality controls, monitoring and remediation activities,
ensuring decisions are translated into operational actions across systems.
