# RACI Matrix – Data Quality Governance

This RACI matrix operationalizes the Governance Operating Model by mapping
governance roles to key data quality lifecycle activities.

The objective is to ensure clear execution responsibilities,
single-point accountability and effective decision-making
across both one-off validations and BAU activities.
