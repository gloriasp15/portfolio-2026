# Governance Effectiveness Metrics

This section defines the key metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the
Governance Operating Model once implemented.

The KPIs focus on **execution efficiency, accountability clarity, data quality
outcomes and business trust**, rather than governance activity volume.
They are designed to measure whether governance decisions translate into
faster resolution, clearer ownership and improved data reliability.

---

## KPI Design Principles

The effectiveness metrics follow four guiding principles:

- Metrics are **outcome-driven**, not activity-driven  
- Accountability and decision ownership are explicitly measurable  
- KPIs are derived from the Governance Operating Model and RACI framework  
- Metrics enable comparison **before vs after** model implementation  

---

## 1. Execution Efficiency

These KPIs measure whether the operating model accelerates execution
and reduces friction in issue resolution.

### Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)

- **Definition**: Average time between issue detection and resolution
- **Formula**:  
  `(Resolution date – Detection date)`
- **Expected impact**: ↓ reduction after governance model rollout
- **Value driver**: Clear ownership and RACI-driven execution

---

### Issue Backlog Aging

- **Definition**: Percentage of open issues exceeding defined SLA thresholds
- **Formula**:  
  `(Issues open > SLA) / Total open issues`
- **Expected impact**: ↓ backlog accumulation
- **Value driver**: Explicit accountability and escalation paths

---

### Decision Lead Time

- **Definition**: Time elapsed between issue identification and decision taken
- **Formula**:  
  `(Decision timestamp – Issue creation timestamp)`
- **Expected impact**: ↓ faster decision-making
- **Value driver**: Single accountable owner per decision (RACI)

---

## 2. Accountability & Ownership Clarity

These KPIs measure whether roles and ownership are clearly understood
and consistently applied.

### Single Accountable Owner Coverage

- **Definition**: Percentage of issues with exactly one accountable owner assigned
- **Formula**:  
  `(Issues with 1 Accountable) / Total issues`
- **Expected impact**: ↑ coverage approaching 100%
- **Value driver**: Ownership layers and RACI enforcement

---

### Escalations Due to Ownership Ambiguity

- **Definition**: Number of escalations caused by unclear ownership
- **Formula**:  
  `Count of escalations tagged as ownership-related`
- **Expected impact**: ↓ reduction over time
- **Value driver**: Clear role definitions and decision rights

---

### Rework Rate Due to Ownership Gaps

- **Definition**: Percentage of issues reopened due to incorrect ownership
- **Formula**:  
  `(Reopened issues due to ownership) / Total resolved issues`
- **Expected impact**: ↓ reduction
- **Value driver**: Correct accountability assignment at issue creation

---

## 3. Data Quality Outcomes

These KPIs assess whether governance improves the actual quality
and reliability of data.

### Critical Data Elements Compliance

- **Definition**: Percentage of critical data elements meeting quality thresholds
- **Formula**:  
  `(Compliant CDEs) / Total CDEs`
- **Expected impact**: ↑ improvement over time
- **Value driver**: Structured lifecycle controls and monitoring

---

### Recurring Issues Ratio

- **Definition**: Proportion of issues recurring after resolution
- **Formula**:  
  `(Recurring issues) / Total issues`
- **Expected impact**: ↓ reduction
- **Value driver**: Root-cause resolution and ownership continuity

---

### Control Effectiveness Rate

- **Definition**: Percentage of controls successfully detecting issues
- **Formula**:  
  `(Effective controls) / Total controls`
- **Expected impact**: ↑ increase
- **Value driver**: Proper control definition and validation stages

---

## 4. Business Trust & Adoption

These KPIs measure whether governance outcomes are trusted
and adopted by business stakeholders.

### Trusted KPI Coverage

- **Definition**: Percentage of business KPIs validated through governed data
- **Formula**:  
  `(Governed KPIs) / Total reported KPIs`
- **Expected impact**: ↑ expansion
- **Value driver**: Data quality assurance and governance alignment

---

### Business-Reported Data Issues

- **Definition**: Number of data issues reported by business users
- **Interpretation**:
  - Short-term ↑ expected (higher awareness)
  - Long-term ↓ expected (improved data quality)
- **Value driver**: Transparency and governance adoption

---

### Stakeholder Confidence Index (Qualitative)

- **Definition**: Periodic qualitative assessment of business confidence in data
- **Measurement**: Survey-based (e.g. 1–5 scale)
- **Expected impact**: ↑ improvement
- **Value driver**: Consistent outcomes and visible ownership

---

## Measurement & Governance Notes

- KPIs should be reviewed periodically as part of governance forums
- Targets and thresholds evolve with governance maturity
- Metrics are intended to support **decision-making**, not control for control’s sake
- KPI ownership follows the same accountability principles defined in the RACI model

---

*These metrics provide a quantitative foundation to demonstrate the
value and effectiveness of the Governance Operating Model over time.*
