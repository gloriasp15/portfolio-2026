# 02. Governance Operating Model  
### Decision-Driven Data Governance Framework

This business case presents a **data governance operating model** designed to clarify decision ownership, enable execution and improve data quality outcomes across complex organizations.

The model focuses on **how data-related decisions are made and executed**, rather than on governance as a purely policy-driven exercise.

---

## Business Context

Organizations operating with advanced data and analytics capabilities often face recurring challenges:

- Unclear data ownership  
- Overlapping roles between business and technology  
- Data Quality issues without a clear resolution path  
- Governance perceived as bureaucracy rather than value  

These challenges typically lead to low trust in KPIs, slow issue resolution, friction between stakeholders and inefficient use of data assets.

---

## Business Solution

A **practical data governance framework** defining **decision ownership across the data–business lifecycle**, built to translate governance principles into operational execution.

The model is structured as a **governance body framework**, combining lifecycle definition, ownership layers and decision enablement mechanisms.

---

## Governance Architecture  
### Three Layers. One Flow.

The governance architecture is organized into three complementary layers:

- **Governance Layer** – Direction and accountability  
- **Control Layer** – Ownership and prioritization  
- **Execution Layer** – Delivery and feedback  

These layers work together to ensure alignment between strategic intent, decision-making and operational execution.

## Governance Body Construction  
### A structured, decision-driven approach

The governance body is constructed through three sequential steps.

---

### 1. Lifecycle Definition *(What)*

Definition of an **end-to-end Data Quality lifecycle**, establishing how data-related work flows from definition to resolution.

This lifecycle provides a shared operational reference across business and technology teams and anchors governance on real processes.

**Lifecycle phases**  
Define · Control · Monitor · Decide · Fix · Validate  

---

### 2. Ownership Levels *(Who)*

Application of **ownership layers** across the lifecycle to clarify **decision rights and responsibilities**.

This step separates direction, decision-making and execution, reducing role overlap and enabling clear prioritization and escalation paths.

**Ownership layers**  
Governance · Control · Execution  

---

### 3. RACI Enablement *(How)*

Establishment of a **RACI-based decision framework** to operationalize ownership and ensure effective execution.

RACI clarifies who executes, who owns the outcome, who provides input and who requires visibility across each phase of the data lifecycle.

**RACI roles**
- Responsible  
- Accountable  
- Consulted  
- Informed  

---

## Effectiveness Metrics  
### Governance & Operational KPIs

The effectiveness of the governance model is measured through governance and operational KPIs, including:

- Decision ownership clarity  
- Time to issue resolution  
- Reduction of recurring data quality issues  
- Improvement in KPI trust and adoption

## Why This Matters

This operating model reframes data governance as a **decision enablement system**, creating a scalable foundation for data, analytics and AI adoption.
