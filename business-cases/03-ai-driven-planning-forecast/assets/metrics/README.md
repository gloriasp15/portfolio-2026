# AI-driven Planning & Forecast Effectiveness Metrics

This section defines the key metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the
AI-driven Planning & Forecast Model once implemented.

The KPIs are designed to evaluate whether **planning intelligence translates** into faster, clearer and more confident **decisions**, rather than focusing exclusively on forecast precision or model performance.

They reflect how planning outputs are consumed in practice by executive teams, capturing improvements in **decision velocity, alignment, execution efficiency and learning over time**.

## KPI Design Principles

The effectiveness metrics follow a set of guiding principles:

- **Decision-centric, not model-centric**  
  Metrics focus on decision outcomes and usage, not on algorithmic accuracy or technical sophistication.

- **Outcome-driven over activity-driven**  
  The emphasis is on changes in decision speed, confidence and execution quality, rather than on planning effort or volume of analysis.

- **Comparable over time**  
  Metrics are designed to support before vs after comparison across planning cycles and decision forums.

- **Human-owned, AI-enabled**  
  Decision accountability remains with business leaders; AI acts as an enabler of interpretation and synthesis

- **Lightweight and governance-compatible**  
  Metrics can be captured through existing planning and governance forums without introducing heavy measurement overhead

## 1. Forecast Accuracy Improvement

- **Definition:** Improvement in forecast accuracy after the introduction of AI-augmented planning and interpretation
- **Formula:**
`(Actual – Forecast| / Actual)`
- **Expected impact:** ↑ Moderate improvement over time
- **Value driver:** More consistent assumptions, faster scenario recalculation and reduced manual manipulation

## 2. Reduction in Planning Cycle Time

- **Definition:** Reduction in the total duration of a planning or re-forecast cycle
- **Formula:**
`(Cycle end date – Cycle start date)`
- **Expected impact:** ↓ Significant reduction
- **Value driver:** Automated signal generation and AI-enabled synthesis replacing manual consolidation and interpretation

## 3. Time-to-Decision Reduction

- **Definition:** Reduction in the time required for executives to reach a decision once planning inputs are available
- **Formula:**
`(Decision timestamp – Planning signal availability timestamp)`
- **Expected impact:** ↓ Time Reduction
- **Value driver:** Executive-ready narratives that surface trade-offs and implications without additional analysis rounds

## 4. Executive Confidence in Planning Outputs

- **Definition:** Degree of executive trust in planning insights used for decision-making
- **Measurement approach:** 
`(Qualitative assessment captured through structured feedback (e.g. Low / Medium / High) or short post-decision surveys)`
- **Expected impact:** ↑ Progressive improvement
- **Value driver:** Transparent signals, consistent interpretation and reduced reliance on parallel analyses

In this context, effectiveness is defined by improved decision quality and speed under uncertainty, not by predictive accuracy alone.
