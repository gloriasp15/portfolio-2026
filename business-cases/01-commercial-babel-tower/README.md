# 🗼 The Commercial Babel Tower  
**Operational Event Orchestration**  
*Turning operational events into shared decisions*

---

## Context

Retail operations generate critical operational events every day across retail, e-commerce and supply functions.  
These events are produced in different systems, interpreted locally and escalated through unstructured channels.

The issue is not data availability, but the absence of a shared operational language that allows events to be prioritized, coordinated and acted upon consistently across teams.

This business case addresses how to transform fragmented operational signals into shared, decision-ready priorities without centralizing control or replacing existing execution systems.

---

## Current Challenges

- Fragmented operational signals across heterogeneous systems  
- Function-driven and subjective priority setting  
- Unstructured exception handling and manual escalations  
- Reporting-driven decision cycles  

---

## Impact on Operations

- Delayed reaction to demand and stock deviations  
- Misaligned priorities across operational teams  
- Overdependence on manual handoffs  
- Breakdown in decision-to-execution traceability  

---

## Business Solution

The Commercial Babel Tower proposes an **Operational Event Orchestration** approach that enables automated multi-source event ingestion, objective prioritization through tiering and centralized operational observability.

Operational events are captured at source using low-code automation, translated into a common signal format and prioritized through predefined scoring rules.  
Tiered events are consolidated into a shared operational backlog and surfaced through e-cards for daily triage and decision-making, with execution and traceability handled downstream when required.

## Operating Model

The operating model follows a sequential flow from event generation to execution and review.

### 1. Event Generation  
Operational events originate independently from:
- Retail / Stores  
- E-commerce  
- Supply & Planning  

Each source operates with its own systems, timing and operational logic.

---

### 2. Low-Code Ingestion  
Events are automatically ingested using low-code automation (e.g. Power Automate), enabling:
- Multi-source ingestion  
- Event normalization  
- Metadata enrichment  

---

### 3. Event Scoring & Tiering  
Each event is objectively scored based on:
- Impact  
- Urgency  
- Recurrence  

This scoring establishes priority tiers (High / Medium / Low), independent of the originating team, creating a shared operational language.

---

### 4. Shared Operational Event Ledger (Babel Tower)

Tiered events are stored in a shared operational repository (e.g. Dataverse), acting as a single source of operational truth where:
- Each event exists once  
- Priority is consistent across teams  
- Ownership and status are explicit  
- Event history is preserved  

This is the translation point where fragmented operational signals become shared, decision-ready inputs.

---

### 5. Shared Attention & Decision (E-Cards)

Prioritized events are surfaced through priority-based e-cards in a shared operational channel (e.g. Microsoft Teams), enabling:
- Cross-team visibility  
- Daily triage and review  
- Coordinated decision-making  

Only relevant, tiered events are exposed, reducing operational noise.

---

### 6. Execution, Monitoring & Review

When formal execution or traceability is required:
- Actions are executed and tracked via ServiceNow or equivalent systems  
- Event status is synchronized back to the operational ledger  

Events remain revisitable, monitorable and exportable for HQ review, monitoring and continuous improvement.

---

## Effectiveness Metrics

- Event-to-decision latency  
- Priority accuracy  
- Escalation rate  
- Resolution cycle time  
- Recurring event patterns  

---

## Key Takeaway

The Commercial Babel Tower does not centralize decisions or replace existing systems.  
It centralizes operational relevance, priority and timing, enabling coordinated execution while preserving local ownership.

## Notes

- Tools mentioned are illustrative  
- The value lies in the operating model, not the technology stack  
- The approach scales from fragmented environments to mature, ticket-driven operations
