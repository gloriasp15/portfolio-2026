# Portfolio 2026

This repository brings together a growing set of business cases developed
throughout 2026, focused on how strategy is translated into execution
through the transformation of business operations.

The work explores operating models, decision ownership, planning and
performance management as the backbone of effective execution, with
data, low-code solutions and AI acting as enablers rather than ends in
themselves.

The portfolio is intentionally designed as a living body of work.
Additional cases, frameworks and reflections will be added over time as
new projects, learning and experimentation take shape across retail,
e-commerce and broader operational contexts.

## Selected Business Cases
